The technology stack used in the GPT-Do-Dah platform includes cutting-edge tools and frameworks that provide a robust and scalable foundation:

- TypeScript: A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript, ensuring a more robust development experience.
- - Rust: A systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency, providing low-level control and high-level abstractions.
- Go: A statically typed, compiled language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency, enabling rapid development of efficient and reliable software.
- Python: A versatile, high-level programming language widely used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and other applications.
- C: A general-purpose programming language providing low-level access to memory and a simple set of keywords, enabling efficient system programming.
- C++: An extension of the C language with added features such as classes, objects, and exceptions, providing both high-level abstractions and low-level control.
- Next.js: A versatile framework for building React applications with server-rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- WebSocket: Enabling real-time communication between the frontend and the backend for seamless user experience.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for web and mobile applications.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, enterprise-class open-source relational database system with over 30 years of active development.
- Milvus: A highly reliable, scalable, and easy-to-use vector search engine, ideal for AI and machine learning applications.
- MinIO: A high-performance, S3-compatible object storage solution that is designed for unstructured data storage and management.
- Prisma ORM: A next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database access and promotes a strong type system.
- Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistency across various environments.
- Kubernetes: An open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- Web3.js: A collection of libraries that allow you to interact with Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, enabling seamless Web3 integration.
- Infura: A scalable, reliable, and secure infrastructure that provides access to Ethereum and IPFS networks, simplifying the process of building and deploying decentralized applications.
- IPFS: InterPlanetary File System, a protocol and network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system, enabling efficient and decentralized data storage.

GPT-Do-Dah platform focuses on creating a strong community where users and developers can actively participate in discussions, contribute code, provide feedback and suggestions, and engage in open-source projects.
